🎮 The Shattered World – A Journey Through Dimensions
The Shattered World is a visually rich, puzzle-platformer built in Unity that challenges players to shift perspectives—literally. Designed as a student group project, this game blends 2D and 3D gameplay mechanics in a seamless, perspective-switching experience where creativity and problem-solving are key.

🔍 Project Summary
Set in Everveil, a mystical world fractured into two dimensions, players control Echo, a brave adventurer tasked with restoring balance by retrieving three ancient artifacts. By switching between 2D and 3D perspectives, players uncover hidden paths, solve complex puzzles, and overcome enemies across three unique biomes: a Flooded Forest, a Lava-Desert hybrid, and a treacherous Icy World.
